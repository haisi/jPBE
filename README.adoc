= jPBE - do as I showed

This is the open source, java implementation of my https://selman.li/thesis[bachelor thesis].

CAUTION: This repo is still a work in progress and not finished, yet alone stable!

== Abstract
Millions of people need to analyze raw data of varying quality to support their job function.
In a lot of cases the present data needs to be refined and processed from its raw form to a more structured format in
order to analyze and visualize it.
This process is time-intensive and error-prone.
Usually tools like Microsoft Excel or OpenRefine are used to improve that process.
However, any nontrivial data wrangling task remains inaccessible to non-programmers.
Furthermore, existing tools only cover the most common use cases, i.e. they are business agnostic.

Programming by example (PBE), a subfield of program synthesis, allows for a natural and intuitive user
interaction mechanism.
Users can specify their intent by providing input output examples for string transformations.

Using PBE for data wrangling is not a novel idea.
Flash Fill is a PBE feature in Excel and Microsoftâ€™s PROSE framework shows the potential of PBE for data wrangling.
However, these existing solutions cannot be integrated into custom software.

Therefore, we developed a custom PBE system for data wrangling tasks.
We describe a custom domain-specific language (DSL) for complex string manipulations.
We present a data structure to represent a large number of programs built in our DSL.
We introduce a custom synthesis algorithm that populates our data structure with programs to transform string inputs
to their intended outputs.

== Example

Imagine you are tasked with analyzing how many of your customers have the same surname.
You are provided with the following list, which has to be processed first to
extract the surname.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Input
|Wanted output

|Peter Smith; 22; Switzerland - Basel
|Smith

|Bob Marley; 18; France - Lyon
|...

|Anna White; 37; USA - Seattle
|...

|...
|...
|===

Your *intent* is to extract the surname.
One possible way to specify your *intent* is to write a short program.
If you do not know how to program you are out of luck.

A more natural and accessible way to *specify your intent* is by providing the computer
with an *input output example* from which a program in synthesised
that satisfies your intent.
